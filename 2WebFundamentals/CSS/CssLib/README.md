## Assignment Notes

I tried to incorporate Christian's feedback after the Profile Page assignment and rework the style.css that I used on it to become this library file.

Based on feedback from others too, I intended to include some organization and comments to make it easier to visually scan the file, and to pre-create some styles to help me mock up a layout from simple html before drilling into the styling specifics.

This will become the base style.css that I use for next week's work, augmenting or correcting it as I find errors or deficiencies.
