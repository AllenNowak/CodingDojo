# Liking Likes

- Part 1
    - uses `index1.html` & `style1.css`
- Part 2
    - uses `index.html` & `style.css`
- Both
    - use the same function in `likes.js`
    - use my library dojo.css, which continues to expand

Everything could still use some cleanup.  E.g., better naming and commenting in the html and I need to go over the css to look for selectors that could be made more generic or remove zero-impact commands.
